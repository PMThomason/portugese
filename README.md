## 🛠️ How to Add Notes

This project is built with simple HTML/CSS to keep it lightweight. To add new content:

1.  **For Vocabulary:** Open `language.html` and add a new `<tr>` (table row) to the `<tbody>` section.
2.  **For History:** Open `history.html` and copy an existing `<section>` block to add a new city or site.
3.  **Commit & Push:** Once you push your changes to the `main` branch, the live site will update automatically within a few minutes.
